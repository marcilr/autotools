Why another guide about autotools?
Autotools Mythbuster
"When I started writing this guide, there weren't many
updated guides on autotools in general; the autoconf
and automake manuals often referred to corner-cases
rather than general ones, and made it difficult to
understand how to write a proper configure.ac or
Makefile.am."
