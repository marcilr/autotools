Autoconf is a tool for producing shell scripts that automatically
configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of
Posix-like systems.  The configuration scripts produced by Autoconf
are independent of Autoconf when they are run, so their users do
not need to have Autoconf.

The configuration scripts produced by Autoconf require no manual
user intervention when run; they do not normally even need an
argument specifying the system type.  Instead, they individually
test for the presence of each feature that the software package
they are for might need.  (Before each check, they print a
one-line message stating what they are checking for, so the user
doesn't get too bored while waiting for the script to finish.)
As a result, they deal well with systems that are hybrids or
customized from the more common Posix variants. There is no need
to maintain files that list the features supported by each
release of each variant of Posix.
