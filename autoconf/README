  Autoconf is a tool for producing shell scripts that automatically
  configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of
  Posix-like systems.  The configuration scripts produced by Autoconf
  are independent of Autoconf when they are run, so their users do
  not need to have Autoconf.
